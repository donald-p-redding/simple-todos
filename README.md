<h2> Simple Todo Manager</h2>
<p>This was one of the early projects I built during the <a href='https://launchschool.com'>Launch School</a> Core Curriculm</p>
<p>The project was written about a year ago, and I am in the process of introducing more AJAX and statlessness to the user experience</p>

<p>The project was intended to focus on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Database backed applications</li>
  <li>Practice deploying an app on a cloud server</li>
  <li>Using a web framework</li>
  <li>Dabbling with JavaScript AJAX/XML requests</li>
</ul>

  <p>This was a very early project with a single, shared database. Please be considerate.</p>
